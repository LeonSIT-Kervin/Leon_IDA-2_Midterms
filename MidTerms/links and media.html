                        <p>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.
                        From the shattered world of Krieg, where loyalty to the Emperor was once bought with rebellion and nuclear fire,
                        the Death Korps was born—soldiers bred for obedience and sacrifice.
                        Cloaked in heavy trench coats and hidden behind gas masks, they march through endless ash and ruin, their home world a barren reminder of their penance.
                        Each guardsman of Krieg fights not for glory or survival, but for redemption—seeking to atone for the sins of their ancestors through death in the Emperor’s name.
                        On countless battlefields, they stand unflinching amid bombardment and flame, their lasguns blazing against the horrors of the galaxy.
                        To them, dying is not defeat—it is duty fulfilled.</p>

                            <p>Through the choking smog and thunder of artillery, the Death Korps advance, their boots sinking into mud slick with blood and oil.
                            The air is poison, but they do not falter; their rebreathers hiss with the rhythm of machines more than men.
                            Commanders shout no orders of retreat—for the soldiers of Krieg know none.
                            In the distance, the enemy’s war machines rise like metal titans, but the Kriegers press on, step by step, their resolve unbroken.
                            When the shells fall, they vanish into the dust, only to emerge again, silent and relentless.

                            Among them walks one nameless guardsman, his regiment long reduced to ashes. He carries the banner of his fallen comrades, the Imperial Aquila still visible through soot and flame.
                            Each breath he takes is borrowed time, each shot fired a prayer. In his heart, there is no hope of survival, only the certainty that his death will buy the Imperium another heartbeat.
                            And as dawn breaks over the battlefield, painting the sky red and gold, the Death Korps of Krieg continue their march—grim shadows in a dying world, fighting on until there is nothing left to give but their bones and their faith.</p>

                            <p>As the final bombardment fell and the ground itself seemed to scream, the nameless guardsman reached the enemy’s fortress—a shattered monolith of twisted steel and heresy.
                            His lasgun clicked empty long ago, yet still he advanced, bayonet gleaming in the firelight.
                            Around him lay the remains of his regiment, their bodies forming a silent wall of devotion.
                            He climbed the rubble-strewn steps, planting the scorched banner of the Imperium atop the ruins as the enemy’s defenses crumbled beneath the relentless fury of the Emperor’s will.

                            When the smoke cleared, there were no victors—only silence and ash. The banner fluttered weakly in the burning wind, a lone testament to the faith of the damned.
                            High above, the sun broke through the clouds for the first time in years, its light touching the bones of Krieg’s children.
                            And though none remained to witness it, their sacrifice was not in vain.
                            For in death, they had redeemed their world—and in the endless war that consumed the stars, the Death Korps of Krieg became legend: men who gave their lives willingly, so that humanity might endure one day more.</p>
